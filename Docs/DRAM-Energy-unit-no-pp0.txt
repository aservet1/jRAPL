Intel has changed the implementation of RAPL without much documentation.

For the Xeon E5 v3 there are two issues:

    The only supported domains are "Package" and "DRAM"
    The "Energy Unit" for DRAM is not the same as the value that is read from the RAPL unit register.   Instead, Xeon E5 v3 processors use a DRAM Energy Unit of 15.3 microJoules.  (Ref:  "Intel Xeon Processor E5-1600/2400/2600/4600 v3 Product Families Datasheet, Volume 2: Registers", document 330784 -- section 5.3.2 in Revision 003).
