// TODO : not necessarily for this sample. but this is just a thought. consider having a source of truth for the C side and a source of truth for the Java side.
//			I know you wanted to have a single source of truth, but it might actually be a detriment if it requires Java programmers searching for that truth to
//			have to dig through native code, especially if they're only Java developers. Consider maybe just enforcing the consistency between the parallel C and Java
//			versions in your code base with what you write down instead and keep in mind that you might need to change it in the other world if you make changes
//			in this world, so you don't need what seem like over engineered native access methods to do simple stuff like return the CSV column header or something.
//			Just a thought. Consider it while you go do the rest of your stuff.
