Coming soon! (don't ask how soon please)

Will hold all of the language barrier interface files for a goRAPL interface, just like
how the folder currently named JNIEXPORTS holds all the language barrier files for the
jRAPL interface.

"language barrier files" are the files that package up the native C functions into the
API calls from the non-C language, like Java for jRAPL or Go for goRAPL
