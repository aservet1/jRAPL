native:
- have it fail and crash if /dev/cpu/x/msr file not found, tell them they need to load the kernel module
  - is there any chance whatsoever that mac or windows would have a /dev/cpu/x/msr file?? maybe prevent
    this slight possibility by just having bazel say 'hey this isnt going to work on your OS, you need linux, sorry'
    - 'os {OS_NAME} not supported. please contact the maintainer of this repo to discuss jRAPL support for your operating system'

jni:
- make sure the JNI string converts the numbers to dot decimal
  - even on a comma decimal machine, if Java is parsing a dot decimal string with Double.toString()

build process:
- consider how to make this the best maven build
- consider making this a bazel build
